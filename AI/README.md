# Tic Tac Toe
## Tic Tac Toe is a simple 2-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their mark ("X" or "O") in an empty spot on the grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent does. If the board fills up and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
