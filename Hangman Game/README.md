## Hangman is a word-guessing game in which one player (or the computer) selects a secret word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess brings the guesser closer to losing, usually visualized as parts of a stick-figure “hanged man” being drawn. The game ends when the word is completely guessed (win) or when the maximum number of wrong guesses is reached (loss).

 ### It is commonly used to improve vocabulary, spelling, and logical deduction skills.
